# Bankers Algo

    The bankerâ€™s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources

    Problem 
        Standard Problem
        
    To Execute

        gcc bankers.c
        ./a.out

    It will ask for a particular instace initially
    
    Afeterwards , the instace can check for safe state , print safe state and check allocation for new process.
    Menu Driven program by taking options
        a - print safe sequence
        b - check safe sequence
        c - check new process can be granted or not
        d - terminate program
